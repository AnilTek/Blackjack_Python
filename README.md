# Blackjack_Python

This code does not include features like insurance (which means if the dealer gets an Ace at the beginning of the round, it gives you a chance to pay half of your bet as an extra. If the dealer gets a blackjack, you get your money back; if not, you don't). Additionally, the double or split features are also not included in this project, nor are side bets. You can add these features if you wish :)
